10. **Game Reset with Settings**: The game reset includes the user's personalized settings (speed, snake skin, etc.) for a seamless experience every time.

### 🌍 **Technologies Used**:

### 💡 **Why I Built This Game?**:
In today’s fast paced world, it's important to blend nostalgia with new technology. This Snake Game not only brings back the classic but also incorporates modern day interactive elements, giving players more control and enjoyment.

I used **JavaScript** for handling game logic, **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI design, and **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering the game elements. Whether you're revisiting your childhood or just looking for a fun break, this game offers a refreshing experience for players of all ages.
