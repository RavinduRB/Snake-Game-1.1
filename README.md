# Snake Game Built with Modern Web Technologies 🐍🎮

### Today I was able to update the snake game I created two months ago to Snake Game 1.1 🚀

I've developed a **modern version of the classic Snake Game**, bringing it into the 21st century with interactive features and a sleek design. Here's an overview of the new functionalities and the cutting edge web technologies used to create this fun and customizable game.

### ❄️ **Key Features**:
1. **Customizable Snake Skins**: Players can now choose from various snake skins using emojis, adding a personalized touch to the gameplay.
2. **Dynamic Game Speed**: A game speed slider lets users adjust the pace of the game to suit their preferences, making the experience more flexible.
3. **Interactive Food Emojis**: Gone are the plain food blocks! Now, food is represented by vibrant emojis like 🍏, 🍎, 🍇, and more.
4. **Gravity Mode**: Food now "falls" with gravity, adding a new layer of challenge and excitement to the game.
5. **Score Display**: Real time score tracking outside the canvas allows players to monitor their progress without any interruptions to the game view.
6. **Modern UI/UX**: A responsive, visually appealing layout featuring gradients, intuitive controls, and sleek button animations make the game a joy to play.
7. **Game Reset with Settings**: The game reset includes the user's personalized settings (speed, snake skin, etc.) for a seamless experience every time.

### 🌍 **Technologies Used**:
- **HTML5** & **CSS3**: The foundation for building a responsive and accessible web based game.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, including game logic, custom controls, and animation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To ensure a clean, modern, and responsive layout with minimal custom styles.
- **Custom Emoji Graphics**: Leveraging emojis to make the snake and food fun, interactive, and easily customizable.

### 💡 **Why I Built This Game?**:
In today’s fast paced world, it's important to blend nostalgia with new technology. This Snake Game not only brings back the classic but also incorporates modern day interactive elements, giving players more control and enjoyment.

I used **JavaScript** for handling game logic, **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI design, and **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering the game elements. Whether you're revisiting your childhood or just looking for a fun break, this game offers a refreshing experience for players of all ages.
